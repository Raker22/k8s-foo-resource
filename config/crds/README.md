CRDs are automatically generated and applied by running `make install`.
It should be run any time a type is updated to ensure the CRDs are up to date.
Types can be set up to generate validation and additional printer columns.
See the [kubebuilder generating CRD documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/beyond_basics/generating_crd.html) for more infomation.
